.Sh NAME
.Nm zfsnap
.Nd create and delete rolling ZFS snapshots
.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl V
|
.Ar <command>
.Op options
.Ar zpool/filesystem ...
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
creates and deletes rolling ZFS snapshots \[em] usually with cron.
.Nm Ap s
main advantages are its portability and that all information needed for
snapshot management is kept in the snapshot name itself.
.Pp
ZFS snapshot names are in the format of Timestamp\-\-TimeToLive
.Pq e.g. zpool/var@2010\-08\-03_02.06.00\-\-1y .
.Pp
The Timestamp includes the date and time when the snapshot was created, and
Time\[hy]To\[hy]Live
.Pq TTL
is the length of time to keep a snapshot before it's ready for deletion.
.
.Ss Top-level Options
The majority of functionality is implemented at the
.Ar <command>
layer. However, a few options can be passed to
.Nm
directly.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl h
Print a summary of
.Nm Ap s
command-line options and then exit.
.It Fl V
Print the version number and exit.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
operates only on snapshots and will
.Em never
destroy or create a pool or filesystem.
.
.Sh Commands
Most
.Nm
actions are performed by using a
.Ar <command> .
All options and arguments passed to a
.Ar <command>
are operated on as they are read
.Pq i.e. sequentially .
This provides the flexibility needed for complex scenarios, but also has the
capacity to bite you if you're not paying attention. Remember,
.Fl n
.Pq dry-run
is provided for a reason.
.Pp
Only one
.Ar <command>
can be passed per invocation of
.Nm .
.
.Ss destroy
By default,
.Nm Cm destroy
will only delete snapshots whose TTLs have expired. However, options
are provided to override that behaviour with more aggressive approaches.
.Pp
Only snapshots created by
.Nm
.Pq or, more specifically, snapshots which match the very specific name pattern it employs
will be considered for deletion.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D
Delete all zfsnap snapshots \[em] regardless of their TTL expiration \[em] on all ZFS file
systems that follow this switch.
.It Fl F Ar age
Force delete all snapshots in all pools exceeding
.Ar age
.Pq defined in TTL format
regardless of their TTL expiration. See
.Sx TTL SYNTAX
for more information.
.It Fl h
Print a summary of
.Cm destroy Ap s
command-line options and then exit.
.It Fl n
Dry\[hy]run. Perform a trial run with no actions actually performed.
.It Fl p Ar prefix
Use
.Ar prefix
for snapshots after this switch.
.It Fl P
Don't use a prefix for snapshots after this switch.
.It Fl r
Operate recursively for snapshots on all ZFS file systems that follow this switch.
.It Fl R
Do not operate recursively for snapshots on all ZFS file systems that follow this switch.
.It Fl s
Skip pools that are resilvering.
.It Fl S
Skip pools that are scrubbing.
.It Fl v
Verbose output.
.El
.
.Ss snapshot
The purpose of
.Nm Cm snapshot
is simple: to create snapshots.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a Ar TTL
Set how long the snapshot should be kept. If not set, the default
.Ar TTL
is one month. See
.Sx TTL SYNTAX
for more information.
.It Fl h
Print a summary of
.Cm snapshot Ap s
command-line options and then exit.
.It Fl n
Dry\[hy]run. Perform a trial run with no actions actually performed.
.It Fl p Ar prefix
Use
.Ar prefix
for snapshots after this switch.
.It Fl P
Don't use a prefix for snapshots after this switch.
.It Fl r
Create recursive snapshots of all ZFS file systems that follow this switch.
.It Fl R
Create non\[hy]recursive snapshots for each ZFS file system that follows this switch.
.It Fl s
Skip pools that are resilvering.
.It Fl S
Skip pools that are scrubbing.
.It Fl v
Verbose output.
.It Fl z
Round snapshot creation time down to 00 seconds.
.El
.
.Sh TTL SYNTAX
The Time\[hy]To\[hy]Live
.Pq TTL
contains numbers and modifiers. Valid modifiers are:
.Bl -tag -width 8n -offset 4n
.It Cm y
years
.Pq calendar
.It Cm m
months
.Pq calendar
.It Cm w
weeks
.It Cm d
days
.It Cm h
hours
.It Cm M
minutes
.It Cm s
seconds
.It Cm forever
a special\[hy]case modifier that will never expire and cannot be used with other TTL modifiers.
Both
.Op Fl F
and
.Op Fl D
will delete snapshots with a TTL of
.Cm forever .
.El
.Pp
You do not need to use all of the modifiers, but they must be used in the above order
.Pq i.e. sequentially .
.Pp
The default TTL is
.Cm 1m
.Pq one month .
.
.Ss TTL Math
When a TTL is added to a date, addition is first done to each field independently,
then month overflows are carried into years, and then all overflows are carried
normally from right to left.

For example, with a date of 2009\-02\-27 and a TTL of 1m3d, the expiration date
is 2009\-03\-30 rather than 2009\-04\-02.

As a corner case, adding 1m (one month) to the date 2009\-10\-31 will result
in an expiration date of 2009\-12\-01 rather than 2009\-11\-30. Because there
are only 30 days in November, one month after October 31st is ambigious. The TTL
math chooses the more conservative result.
.
.Ss TTL Examples
.Bl -tag -width 8n
.It Cm 1y6m5d2h
One year, six months, five days, and two hours
.It Cm 18m
Eighteen months
.It Cm 90M
Ninety minutes
.It Cm 86400s
Eighty-six thousand and four hundred seconds
.Pq 1 day
.El
.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
exits 0 on success and 1 if an error occurs.
.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Nm
was designed to work with cron. Thus, some of these examples will include cron
markup.
.Pp
Every hour, create recursive snapshots of an entire pool and keep for 5 days.
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Minute  Hour  Day  Month  Day  Who   Command
5         *     *    *      *    root  /sbin/zfsnap snapshot \-a 5d \-r zpool
.Ed
.Pp
Create snapshots of different datasets in different zpools and keep for 2 weeks.
.Pp
.Dl zfsnap snapshot \-a 2w zpool2/git zpool2/jails \-r zpool2/jails/main zpool1/var
.Pp
Note that
.Op Fl a ,
.Op Fl r ,
and
.Op Fl R
can be used many times in a single line.
.Pp
Now, for a more complex example. Here,
.Nm
will snapshot
.Bl -dash -compact -offset 2n
.It
zpool/var recursively and hold it for 1 year
.It
zpool/home recursively and hold it for 6 minutes
.It
zpool/usr recursively and hold it for 3 months
.It
zpool/root non\[hy]recursively and hold it for 3 months.
.El
.Pp
.Dl zfsnap snapshot \-a 1y \-r zpool/var \-a 6M zpool/home \-a 3m zpool/usr \-R zpool/root
.Pp
Deleting ZFS snapshots is much slower than creating them, and it's usually not
a problem if snapshots live a few hours longer. Thus, it is usually best to
delete old snapshots once a day.
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Minute  Hour  Day  Month  Day  Who   Command
0         1     *    *      *    root  /sbin/zfsnap destroy \-r zpool
