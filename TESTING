TEST LOCALLY

Runnings tests locally is easy and quite fast; it usually takes less than a
minute. To kick-off the tests:

  cd zfsnap/tests
  ./run.sh

TEST ACROSS OSs

To run the above tests across many OSs, you will need Vagrant installed and
enough hard drive space to handle the VMs. Vagrant will automatically download
the boxes for you.

  cd zfsnap/tests/vagrant
  ./test_vagrants.sh --all

The actual copying and executing happens in the VagrantFile, via the
provisioning which runs each time a box is started. Given there are so many
boxes, they are not kept running, as together they'd consume quite a bit of RAM.

The --help option will list all options available. A subset of the VMs can be
selected as well, such as --all-bsd, --all-sunos, etc.

To focus on one particular OS, you can ssh into an already running box:

  vagrant ssh omnios

or you can develop in your host OS, and just reprovision a running box:

  vagrant provision omnios

TEST ACROSS SHELLS

Typically I run this inside of the wheezy box, as Debian has many shells
available in their repos.

  vagrant ssh wheezy
  sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install -y ash bash dash pdksh posh zsh
  cd /tmp/zfsnap/tests/vagrant
  ./test_shells.sh --all-good

MAN PAGE CLEANLINESS

While most systems ship utilities that can format mdoc, not all actually ship
the mandoc utility; BSDs and new SunOS systems tend to have it. To run lint
testing:

  vagrant ssh freebsd10 (if needed)
  cd /tmp/zfsnap
  mandoc -Tlint man/man8/zfsnap.8
